## 💡 Inspiration

With increasing financial fraud, money laundering, and sanction evasions, organizations need an AI-powered risk assessment system that automates entity verification, transaction monitoring, and risk classification using LLMs, news sentiment analysis, and global sanction lists.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- **🔍 Risk Score Calculation:**  
  Analyzes entities and transactions for sanction violations and geopolitical risk.

- **📰 News Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Uses Google News API and FinBERT to detect negative press coverage.

- **⚖️ Sanctions & Compliance:**  
  Cross-checks entities with OFAC, UN, FATF, EU, and OpenSanctions API.

- **🤖 AI Chatbot:**  
  Provides an interactive risk assessment chatbot using Ollama (Mistral-7B) and Gemini LLM, enhanced with text-to-speech (TTS) support for voice-based responses.

- **🔎 Entity Recognition:**  
  Extracts company details using NER-based classification.

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Backend:** Python for API development  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit UI for real-time risk analysis  
- **AI Models:**  
  - Mistral-7B (via Ollama)  
  - Gemini LLM  
  - ProsusAI/FinBERT  
- **Data Processing:**  
  - FAISS for similarity search  
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- **APIs Used:**  
  - OpenSanctions  
  - Google News API  
  - SEC EDGAR  
  - Offshore Trust API

---

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

- **Large Model Latency:**  
  Mistral-7B required optimizations for faster inference.

- **Data Processing Complexity:**  
  Handling unstructured news and entity recognition required NER-based classifiers.

- **API Limitations:**  
  Google News API rate limits required caching strategies.

- **Deployment Issues:**  
  Streamlit + Ollama setup needed proper environment configurations.
